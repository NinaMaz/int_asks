# int_tasks
This repo contains the following files:
* task1.ipynb - contains the solution to task1
* task2.py - a script that generates an image as a solution for task 2. In order to run the script, make sure you have `torch` and `opencv` installed. 

  In order to run the script with the input image `1.jpg` and output path `2.jpg`:
  
  ```
  python3 task2.py -f 1.jpg -o 2.jpg
  ```


* task2.ipynb - is a notebook that contains the solution to task2 and more elaborately describes my thinking process. Additoinally, I have left two worse-performing variants of the solution there.
